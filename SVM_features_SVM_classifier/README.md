Step 01: give the 'batch' folder location to cumul-feature.py file

Step 02: run python cumul-feature.py

Step 03: a new file will be created in /cumul directory named cumul.testfeat

Step 04: We have to feed this new file location to SVM classifier.

Step 05: go to libsvm-3.20-src folder

Step o6: issue make command

Step 07: go to tools folder

Step 08: run easy.py file specifying the /cumul directory

e.g. python easy.py /home/mr6564/Desktop/WF/CodesandData/cumul/cumul.testfeat
