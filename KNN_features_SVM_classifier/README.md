Step 01: give the 'batch' folder location to knn-svm.py file

Step 02: run knn-svm.py file

Step 03: this will create a new file in a new directory KNN_SVM named knnsvmtest.

Step 04: We have to feed this new file location to SVM classifier. 

Step 05: go to libsvm-3.20-src folder

Step o6: issue make command

Step 07: go to tools folder

Step 08: run easy.py file specifying the /KNN_SVM directory

e.g. python easy.py /home/mr6564/Desktop/WebsiteFingerprinting/KNN_SVM/knnsvmtest
